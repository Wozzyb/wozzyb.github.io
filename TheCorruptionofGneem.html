        <h3>Role: Level Designer</h3>
        <h3>Role: Programmer</h3>
        <h3>Game Type: Game Jam</h3>

        This game jam was one of the first few I ventured outside of UCI to do and It was an eye-opening experience. My team was also just starting out but since it was over the internet I had a hard time managing and maintaining the project progress. Our programmer took way too long to push out his deliverables and I had to take his place and code my own movement system to cover the slack. The 3d designer got busy a couple of days into the jam so we had to shift gears and make a 2.5 game.

        The project had a lot of hurdles but ultimately, we managed to publish it on time. <em> (Although I had to crunch a bit) </em>
