        <h3>Game Type: Quarter Game</h3>

        This was one of my first quarter-long games. Honestly, I had no idea If I’d be even able to manage to join a project like this, but Estiban and the others were really welcoming. This was my first ever game with Unreal and I struggled to learn the tools on top of a grueling 3d modeling class. I made one of the tracks and a 3d model of one of the racer vehicles.
        <br>
        <br>
        Perforce was one of the harshest tools I had to learn but this project was my introduction to it and for that I am glad.
