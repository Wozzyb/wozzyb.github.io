            <h3>Role: Lead</h3>
            <h3>Role: Game Designer</h3>
            <h3>Game Type: Game Jam</h3>

            This was a game jam I led with a group of new developers. It was also during the game jam that I realized that I didn’t enjoy not being in engine. Leading people is awesome but also extremely stressful. While I can handle the stress and always put myself in leadership positions, I also like to make things. I made the map layout of the game and arranged the planets in a way that allowed for fun and enticing gameplay.

            I enjoyed showing those who weren’t as experienced as me in engine a way around their bugs and frustrations. A couple of them went out and led their own games during that quarter and I’d like to think it’s because I gave them a good first impression with the game development process.
