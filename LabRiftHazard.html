        <h3>Role: Game Designer</h3>
        <h3>Game Type: Game Jam</h3>


        <p>
            I stumbled onto this game jam when I was looking for cool projects to make and I do not regret it. It was a small team of 3 and I was responsible for designing and balancing the game, we had an artist/ programmer and a sound composer. The game feel for this game is something I’m proud of <em>(even though it took a bit to get right)</em>.
        </p>
        <br>
        I was also responsible for the upgrade concepts and the exp system for this game. Balancing how slowly the player gains power/ upgrades was a cool experience that I enjoy doing, but don’t necessarily get the chance to.
