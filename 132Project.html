            <h3>Role: UX Designer</h3>

            <h3>Project Type: UX Project</h3>


            This project was done in my Informatics 132 class at UCI. We were making a prototype of an application and had to go through a lot of iterations just to get to something we liked.
            <br>
            <br>

            First, we came up with a problem statement <strong> How do we help with consistency in the workplace for professionals </strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            we soon realized that our problem statement was too vague and we adjusted it to <strong> How do we help people with time blindness stay consistent with time management </strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            Soon after we edited our problem statement we did a competitive analysis.
            <br>

            <br>
            Then we made an affinity diagram to help us figure out which features and aspects of our application we’d like to have, what our target audience would be struggling with, and how to tailor the application to that audience
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            After which we created a persona of who our target audience would be. That way we could have a solid grasp on who we need to design for.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Persona.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>
            Then we made storyboards on what situations our application would be effective/ helpful to our user.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Storyboard 1.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Storyboard 2.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>
            We then made lofi prototypes of our application.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Lo-Fi Prototype 1.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Lo-Fi Prototype 2.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>

            Then a mid fi prototypes
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Mid-Fi Prototype.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>
            Then a Hifi prototype.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="Productivity App Hi-Fi Prototype.png" alt="A picture of a stickman, surrounded by monsters" />
            <br>
            And after all those steps our team decided that we got the application to a state that we could actively work on.
