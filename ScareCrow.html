            <h3>Game Type: Game Jam</h3>
            This was the first game jam that I had to take leadership for and <em>(while stressful)</em> It was fun. I was the main programmer and game designer. Up until this point, I didn’t know the stress of only having one programmer and I didn’t rest Until the end of the jam. The game scope was set early on since I wasn’t going to be at the game jam for the entirety of the 48 hours. We had to scrap animations and a handful of level designs. Ultimately we managed to finish the game on time and had a blast doing it.

            I worked with some talented 3d artists and animators, and working with them in engine is what made the game look as amazing as it does.
