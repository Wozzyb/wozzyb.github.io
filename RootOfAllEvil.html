            This was one of the first projects I’ve ever worked on and It helped me set in stone my design style as well as how I interact with others in a project. I helped prototype the concept of each attack, the map layout, as well as the win-and-lose mechanics. Dashing was a quirk that showed up in the middle of programming and we loved it so we kept it in.

            Ultimately I hold this project dear to me since It was one of my first ever projects that I collaborated on. Working with people experienced in unity was a blast and I learned a lot of game design tips off of it. <em>(It also started out my small collection of Game Design Documents)</em>.
