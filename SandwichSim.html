        <h3>Role: Game Designer</h3>
        <h3>Game Type: Quarter Game</h3>


        I joined this project to help out my friends since they didn’t have a dedicated designer for the game. Everyone only had one or 2 tasks and my task was to make the layout of the kitchen and its contents. We went through 2 iterations of kitchen layouts and finally, we picked what is seen in the game.

        I had a lot of fun making this game since it was pure chaos and it turned out better than I thought! <em> (we also allowed the player to play a different game, within our game which I thought was wild and hilarious)</em>
