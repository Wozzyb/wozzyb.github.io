            <h3>Role: Game Designer</h3>
            <h3>Role: Economy Designer</h3>
            <h3>Game Type: Quarter Game</h3>

            This game was the first one Where I worked with an enormous team. Being able to think and celebrate with others on game ideas and concepts was amazing. Being able to bounce ideas off of each other was something that finally made me realize that game design was my passion.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game was based on a UCI student’s life pursuing a GDIM degree <em>(Game Design and Interactive Media)</em> Over time we came up with the school system and structure the game has and its multiple loss conditions. We added mental health, an energy economy system, and school work to be done. All to simulate the experience of being in the GDIM major as a UCI student.
            <br>
            <br>
            Working with all the disciplines was an amazing experience that helped me understand what each branch of game development does and allowed me to see how everything came together.
