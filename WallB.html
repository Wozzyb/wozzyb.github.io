        <h3>Role: Level Designer</h3>
        <h3>Game Type: Game Jam</h3>
        We started making this game during EGD x SGDA Spring Game Jam 2023. Honestly, It was one of the most interactive and fun experiences I've ever had. We originally started with a level built entirely in white cubes in unity and we slowly replaced assets in. Took a bit to work out where everything should go but I enjoyed level-designing the map.

        <br>
        The concept was based on Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, a game that was made to specifically be rage-inducing. We all make an homage to the first tree in sexy man hiking (<em>the game that Getting Over was based on</em>).
