        With Wall-B done, and Isekai Truck done, I joined the studio sol game development studio at my school and we began making Edo Edo Teishoku <em>(A rouge-like, jpg, cooking, timer-based game)</em> I made everything from recipe concepts to boss kits. Currently, we have 62 recipes, 5 bosses, 10 garnishes <em>(that are done, we have about 40 that aren’t implemented yet)</em>, 3 skill trees, and about 20 different events for the player to experience.

        The team I’ve worked with is remarkable at what they do, from audio to programming to the artists.
        <br>
        <br>
        Everyone is insanely talented and I am glad to have found them when I did.
