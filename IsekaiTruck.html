            <h3>Role: Level Designer</h3>
            <h3>Game Type: Game Jam</h3>
            We started making this game during GMTK Game Jam 2023. Making the map and filling in the map wasn’t the most fun but we ended up having an amazing game with a lot of game juice. The theme of the jam was ‘Role Reversal’ and we just took that and ran with it. I started designing this map on paper, and it took me about 5 iterations to get the map where the team would like it to be. After that, it was off to unity where I implemented it along with its colliders.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game also has a scoring system and multiplier similar to UltraKill <em>(which we were inspired by to make the multiplier)</em>
